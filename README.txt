Source Code for 164738 submission.

The main file is a Python Notebook called 'StyleTransferSystem.ipynb'.
The extension task is also a Python Notebook called 'ExtensionTaskClassifier.ipynb'.

The helper python '.py' files are also needed in the same directory as these notebooks. 

The demonstration image in the 'images' folder is taken by myself and does not require consent or credit to a third party.

---USING PRE-TRAINED STYLE NETWORKS---
If you wish to use the pre-trained networks, please download the Pretrained_Models.zip file from below.
There are links to either the Sussex User hosting, or a Google Drive link if accessing remotely.
You then need to unzip the folder and place it in the same directory as the other files.

Sussex Hosting (PREFERED):
http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~sw505/Pretrained_Models.zip

Google Drive:
NOTE: Sometimes when downloading from Google Drive, two binary files are treated as '.mp3' files for an unknown reason.
If this occurs, delete the files, and download them seperately and replace them in the same directory.
These files are typically within 'greatwave_lap_instance' and 'greatwave_lap_instance_lowweight'.
